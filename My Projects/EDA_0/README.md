U.S. Housing Prices & Population Growth (1975–2019)
Exploratory Data Analysis (R Project)
# Overview

This project investigates how population growth and population density affect real house price changes in the United States from 1975 to 2019.
Using publicly available datasets, the analysis explores national, regional, and state-level housing trends before, during, and after the 2008 financial crisis.

# Tools & Libraries

Language: R

Packages: tidyverse (ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr), readxl

Visualization: Multi-facet regional plots, log-scaled density comparisons, and regression smoothers

Reporting: Reproducible RMarkdown → PDF output

# Key Findings

Inflation-adjusted house prices have risen significantly since 1975, led by the West and South regions.

The 2008 housing crash caused a sharp but temporary dip in all regions, with recovery beginning after 2012.

Population growth and density show a positive correlation with long-term house price increases — especially in California, Texas, and Florida.

States with stable or declining populations (e.g., West Virginia) experienced weaker housing price growth or decline.

# Takeaways

This project demonstrates key skills in:

Data wrangling and cleaning

Exploratory visualization using ggplot2

Economic interpretation of data trends

Reproducible reporting with RMarkdown

The analysis transforms raw datasets into meaningful insights about how demographic shifts shape long-term housing market trends in the U.S.
